# Ridesharing works!

<->

# What is fundamentally driving adoption of ridesharing?
- Smartphones
- GPS
- Cheap cellular data

===

# Other non-essential factors:
- Marketing
- Lobbying
- Venture funding
- Logistics
- Data Science
- Global Scale

===

# The only essential ingredients are citizen participation and information sharing

===

# The technology is not rocket-science - it's collaboration software

<->

# What if you didn't need a team of developers to build and operate a TNC?

===

# What if you didn't need any developers?

Note: Starting a carpool group should be as easy as installing an app, and that app
should work as well as the ride-sharing apps we've recently grown to love, more recently
started to miss.

authentication.

on the move, and whether anyone is running behind or ahead of schedule.

The platform tallies up points by person, by organization, and across entire cities.
