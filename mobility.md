# Ridesharing works!

<->

### Q: What is fundamentally driving adoption of ridesharing?
### A:
- Smartphones
- GPS
- Cheap cellular data

===

### Other non-essential factors:
- Marketing
- Lobbying
- Venture funding
- Logistics
- Data Science
- Global Scale

===

### The only essential ingredients:
- Citizen participation
- Information sharing

===

### The technology is not rocket-science
### It's collaboration software

<->

### What if:
### You didn't need a team of developers to build and operate a TNC?

===

### What if:
### You didn't need any developers at all?

Note: Starting a carpool group should be as easy as installing an app, and that app
should work as well as the ride-sharing apps we've recently grown to love, more recently
started to miss.

# Launch

Note: Anyone who wants to set up a ridesharing company or coop can download and
run the software.

# Sign-up

Note: Users can create an account in about a minute, or in seconds using Facebook
authentication.

schools, churches, or interest groups.  The application helps organize and plan carpools
that are easy for everyone involved.

# Get Moving

Note: Mobile companion apps keep drivers and riders notified about who is where, who is
on the move, and whether anyone is running behind or ahead of schedule.

The platform tallies up points by person, by organization, and across entire cities.
