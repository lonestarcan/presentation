Ridesharing is: Green, cool, and easy
1. Green-Reduces pollution in environment otherwise created by riding separately
2. Frees up highest and best use of land that may be converted from parking to additional residential, commercial, or public use.
2. Creates Commerce-Saves money from reduced percapita transportation & energy costs-a fraction of the of driving separately.
3. Frees up land-use need 
3. Improves Quality of Life-Fun & Easy way to create commerce through mutually beneficial relationship in the community.

Carpool Formation-easy commute offers a ridematching tool to simplify and encourage the formation of carpools and vanpools.
It's easy... It's green... its a carpool... GET ON BOARD!

Each carpool (4 riders) reduces greenhouse gases by 12,000 lbs annually? (equivalent to 500 gallons of gasoline.)

The average american spends 434 hours (18 days) in their car each year.
The US could save 33 million gallons of gasoline each day if average commuter passenger load were increased by 1 person.
